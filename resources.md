## Steering Modifications
Our team has been creating steering modifications for modified ride-on cars (GoBabyGo) and the Permobil Explorer Mini. 

#### Modified Ride-on Car Modifications
All modified ride-on car adaptations are designed to mount on a steering wheel. We have found that a layer of Dycem between the 3D print and the wheel helps them stay in place. A bolt similar to those used for bike attachments is then used to hold it in place.

[Click here](https://github.com/miahoffmannd/miahoffmannd.github.io/blob/main/3dprints/steering-knob-ROC.STL) to get the file for the steering knob. This is a large ball that can be mounted on the steering wheel of a modified ride-on car.

[Click here](https://github.com/miahoffmannd/miahoffmannd.github.io/blob/main/3dprints/steering-rod-ROC.STL) to get the file for the steering rod. This is a vertical rod that can be mounted on the steering wheel of a modified ride-on car, a la pirate ship wheel.

#### Permobil Explorer Mini Modifications
All Explorer Mini adaptations are designed to replace the yellow ball on top of the joystick. There is a set screw underneath the very end of the yellow ball that allows it to be removed. The same set screw can then be used to place any of these alternative toppers.

[Click here](https://github.com/miahoffmannd/miahoffmannd.github.io/blob/main/3dprints/bike-handle-EM.STL) for an attachment that looks like a bike handle bar.

[Click here](https://github.com/miahoffmannd/miahoffmannd.github.io/blob/main/3dprints/donut-climbing-jug-EM.STL) for an attachment that looks like a "jug"-style-hold for climbing. This one has been nice because it allows kiddos to hook their fingers into the hold.

[Click here](https://github.com/miahoffmannd/miahoffmannd.github.io/blob/main/3dprints/vertical-pole-EM.STL) for a 3" vertical rod attachment that can be used to increase the visual height of the joystick.
