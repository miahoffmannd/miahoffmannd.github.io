## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="headshot-June-2022.jpg" alt = "Mia Hoffman" width = 30>

Mia Hoffman is a fifthh-year PhD Candidate, co-advised in both the Departments of Mechanical Engineering and Rehabilitation Medicine at the University of Washington. She is also a student member of the Center for Research and Education on Accessible Technology and Experiences ([CREATE](https://create.uw.edu/)) at the University of Washington. She received her Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Notre Dame with a minor in bioengineering. Mia's research is at the intersection of biomechanics, accessibility, and rehabilitation medicine and focuses on the design and translation of mobility and accessible play technologies for young children. Mia's goal in her work is to "just let kids be kids" exploring the world around them. 

## Research Interests
1. On-time Mobility
2. Accessible Play Technologies
3. Environmental Accessibility
